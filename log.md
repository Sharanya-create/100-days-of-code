### Day 1:COVID 19 tracker web application date:17-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with COVID 19 tracker web application on Flask Framework using jinja, python , html and css

**Thoughts:** I had this notion that we can't build a COVID 19 tracker without React.js but i found out that a simple animation less tracker can be built using python and html as well.

**Link to work:** would upload after building the application entirely..check for link in day 2 or 3

### Day 2:COVID Tracker web application date:18-05-2020 


**Today's Progress**: Completed the web application

**Thoughts**: It was an amazing time developing this mini-project. I learnt a new concept of jinja, a template engine that allows developers to write python logic on the html templates.
