# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Took up the challenge and commited to it on twitter and LinkedIn date: 16-05-2020
### Day 1:COVID 19 tracker web application date:17-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with COVID 19 tracker web application on Flask Framework using jinja, python , html and css

**Thoughts:** I had this notion that we can't build a COVID 19 tracker without React.js but i found out that a simple animation less tracker can be built using python and html as well.

**Link to work:** would upload after building the application entirely..check for link in day 2 or 3

### Day 2:COVID Tracker web application date:18-05-2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the web application

**Thoughts**: It was an amazing time developing this mini-project. I learnt a new concept of jinja, a template engine that allows developers to write python logic on the html templates.

### Day 3: Bitwise operator challenge-hackerrank date:19-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the bitwise operator challenge on hackerrank in C programming

**Thoughts**:This challenge troubled me since 5 days, only 4 out of the 14 testcases were passing, Later I found out that there was problem with array size and not my logic.

### Day 4:Began with building a COVID 19 tracker  react application and backend for beautician website date:20-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded visual studio and began with coding. Began with backend for login and registration forms for beautician website. Coded for some 2 hrs.

**Thoughts**: It was my dream to build a react application and know it's details.Hence bringing this dream true. 

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 5: Completed backend developement(database part) of registration and login forms for beautician website and would go on for more perfection in it date:21-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed backend for beautician website (login , logout and registration) would look at more perfection like allowing user to see the password typed on click, asking user to make password secure and fix a length and give to error message if user doesn't exist or password wrong etc as now the site considers the fact and gives appropriate response. Further to work on the message part 

**Thoughts**:This is my first website with backend developed for it. This was actually an assignment from college but didn't receive enough training on backend through mentors due to lockdown and I am very happy to write it here that I am the first to complete it among my fellow mates.

**Link(s) to work**: (link to backend of login,logout and registration forms and frontend/UI design only) https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Webpage

### Day 6: Coded a java applet to detect key events and another applet takes the text and writes it to given file date:22-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the code for detecting the key pressed and key released event on applet and the applet viewer would display whatever typed. The other applet took input of file name and text and wrote the text to that file.

**Thoughts**:Have a plan of attaching the second applet project to browser as extension so that it would act as a notepad for browser, for me to take notes while I am surfing through browser.

**Link(s) to work**: key eventhandling applet: https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Applet2.java
would upload after completion ie after I attach the applet to browser as extension.

### Day 7: Completed the second Java applet, mentioned in day 6 with total perfection in orientation and fonts date:23-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the applet that writes text to a given file.

**Thoughts**: I discarded my plan of adding my applet to my browser as i found that chrome no longer supports Java pluggins and the only way to view applet on browser was adding it to html using Applet tag and viewing using some extensions like CheerpJ, let tab etc. I wanted to keep this project java specific and did not wanted to mix html with it as my favourite combination with html is css, js and offcourse jinja which is python template engine. However adding the applet to chrome would not serve the purpose as i have to switch tabs between my applet page and the current surfing page.

### Day 8:Proceeded with backend developement of beautician website for products pace

**Today's Progress**:Was able to code for one and half hour on the product page of haircare products

**Thoughts**: have some bugs troubling will be resolving them in the coming days.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after I complete all the product pages.

### Day 9: Proceeded with  development of covid 19 tracker application and practiced some java programs on interface in academic interest  date:25-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 2 hours, 1 hour on tracker and other on the interface programs. Completed one fourth of the tracker application( till one card up and running)

**Thoughts**: Inspite of my severe headache I managed to code on covid 19 tracker and Java programs but sadly could not update the repo on day 9 itself and hence updating it on day 10. No headache can decrease my passion for coding.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion of covid 19 tracker application

### Day 10: Completed sum of sub array challenge on geeks for geeks date: 26-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: got an institution rank of 27 and score 2 as per alloted for the program.

**Thoughts**: my logic worked well for almost all test cases and errors I managed to correct but I felt it almost impossible to get the execution time down. But then finally I managed to do it with a piece of extra code statement and the execution time was 0.58s

### Day 11: Proceeded with covid 19 tracker react application date:27-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: was able to code only for an hour with the internal assisments comming up , but though I have already completed almost of the mini project, only styling and the graph part remains.

**Thoughts**: Visual studio crashed on my laptop and installing it all again would take more of internet and time. Hence I installed node.js separately on my laptop, added the path to environment variable and began with the development on Atom editor. Was able to code and get all the cards up and running with the count animation applied.

### Day 13: Stringstream and strings challenge on hackerrank date:29-05-2020

**Today's progress**: Completed the above mentioned challenges on c++ in hackerrank and now i am only 50 points away from my 4th star in c++

**Thoughts**:Coded for 2 hours and obtained 20 points for the challenges. I had started hackerrank during my study holidays in second sem just before externals in c and managed to get 3 stars within 2 weeks but then i got busy in academics and had paused coding on hackerrank and used platforms like sololearn for completeing tutorials on programming languages and experimenting on codes, likewise i have 61 codes written in sololearn on c language and i use it only for experimenting on programs. I resumed C language and started C++ in hackerrank recently and managed to get 3 stars, silver batch in c++ in 2 weeks, provided not coding continuously on it due to circumstances, however i coded on other languages like html, php,css,mysql,js,java and python. Now my aim is to get gold batch in both c and c++ within lockdown.

### Day 14: Completed multiple challenges on hackerrank date:30-05-2020
 
**Today's progress**: Coded for 2 and half hours in c++ and obtained 4th star. Now i am only 35 points away to my gold bagde.

**Thoughts**: As i completed my 3rd internal assisments today, I was able to code for 2 and half hours and complete multiple challenges on hackerrank. Soon i will obtain my gold badge.

### Day 15: Coursera coding assignments date:31-05-2020

**Today's progress**:Coded for about one and half hours and completed the last remaining two coding assignments on Coursera platform under "python to access web data" course and got my certificate. 

**Thoughts**: This course dealt with web scrapping, JSON data parsing and interacting with APIs. Assignment was all about parsing JSON data and getting the required information, interacting with Google API and Geojson API to get the place id from the JSON data for a given location that required parsing of JSON data and iterating over dictionaries and lists.

**Link(s) to work**: abiding by the Coursera honor code I can't open source my solution as any one would use it for their assignments. Henceforth providing verification link for my certificate.

### Day 16: proceeded with covid 19 tracker react application date:01-06-2020

**Today's progress**: Got the line chart up and running by coding for 1 and half hours

**Thoughts**: There were lots and lots of errors which I debugged and completed the line chart next is to put up the bar chart, country picker and style the page. Due to migraine I wasn't able to update the log on 16th , hence updating it today. This morning when I felt completely fine I suddenly remembered about the log and updated it immediately. I guess I order to make my headache go down I need to code for the whole day which magically stops my headache until I am coding!!

**Lin(s) to work**: Would upload after completion

### Day 17: Hackerrank C++- gold badge date:02-06-2020

**Today's progres**: Earned a gold badge and got certified on c++ from hackerrank. Current rank:41833

**Thoughts**: As mentioned in previous log commit i required 35 points more to get a gold badge but i solved two challenges and managed to get 55/35 one of 30 points and other of 25.

### Day 18: python3 scrapper Program date:03-06-2020 

**Today's progress**: Completed a scrapper Program in python3 and converted it to software using pyinstaller. I had done a similar program much before but then today I completely re wrote it in a better way.

**Thoughts**: I completed my scraper program in 1.15 hr and this program handles some cases like, if the user bymistakeky executes the program instead of other program then it gives an exit option. If the user wants to scrape the same website again after once done then this situation is also handled as like the user need not enter the URL again and again. Github doesn't allow upload of files above 100 hence i cannot upload the software but below is the link to program.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/blob/master/scrapdemo.py

### Day 19: Hackerank challenges date:04-06-2020

**Today's progress**: Completed student marks sum challenge in c and began with python challenges. Solved 4 basic introductory challenges on pyhton3 (simple beginner level challenges) and earned the first star.

**Thoughts**: I have decided to code on python and c side by side and aim for gold badge for both. 

**Link(s) to work**: my solution for student marks sum challenge: https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/blob/master/student_mark_sum.c not uploading python as they are simple hello world kind of challenges i completed them just for a start with python would upload next challenges onwards.

### Day 20: Google reg.form clone-swings and Data Scraper date:05-06-2020

**Today's Progress**: Began developing a registration form on Java swings and coded a website for scrapping the reviews for my college.

**Thoughts**: me and my professor have taken up a project to build a sentimental analysis tool by taking metrics such as ratings and reviews of our college, which helps us to know flaws in college systems and facilities. My role is to provide data to my professor using data Scraper  analysis of which will be conducted by sir. I started building a different type of scraper website than my previous project which will have option to scrape all those top websites which provide review of our college and for today I coded for about 6hours. As I was working till now, I am updating log of 5th June on 6th June 1am. 

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion of the data Scraper part of the project.

### Day 21: Data Scraper website for analysis date:06-06-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed index page of the web application and setted it up on Flask Framework.

**Thoughts**: Yesterday while I was building the scraper page for my college I thought I would not use flask and just keep it like separate html files that would open on browser on a click. But then I wanted to give it a typical web application look that would open the index page when the development server would start. Hence I coded the main.py and set my application on Flask, along with which I completed the index page with CSS animation properties such as the content on the page would fade in appear on load. Today I coded for 1.5 hrs.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload it soon when I complete the scraper sites for all the top colleges of Mangalore and then push it to GitHub. 

### Day 22:Google Registration form clone date:07-06-2020

**Today's progress**: Completed rgistration form using java swings and even completed the second page, scraper page for second top college for my data scraper website. Coded for 4 hours.

**Thoughts**: I have made my registration form look almost similar to google forms for that can be built for registration, the only differences are that i have not used a post method for sending the details to the form owner but have given a local file path where the details are written using java file handling concepts and i have replaced the submit button with register as it would suit much on swings frame interface. I have used Jframe, Jlabel, JButton, JTextField components of java swings. This form mimics the functionality of simple google form for registration. With 3 fields for entering name,mobile number and email. It is used only for demonstration of working of a form. Google form will be coded with javascript and i have coded my form  with java.

**Link(s) to work**: https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Registration%20Form/src/Swing/Reg.java

### Day 23: Data scraper website for competitive analysis date:08-06-2020

**Today's progress**: completed the 3rd scraper site for one of the top college of Mangalore and did some styling for my pages and added previous links to the pages applicable and coded main.py for the action.

**Thoughts**: I have one more page to go and then scraper part for the competitive analysis tool will be ready. After i complete the scraper web appliaction, I would continue with my covid 19 tracker react application.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload to github after completion

### Day 24: Data Scraper website for competitive analysis date:09-06-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4th web page for extracting reviews for 4th top college with this I completed 95% of my mini project and now only some styling and testing remains.

**Thoughts** this Mini project is developed on Flask framework with python and html, CSS, js and bootstrap. Updating the log on 11th June as I had actually missed updating it on 9th, got a bit confused due to lab exam pressure and then thought that I had already updated the log hence when I saw one day missing today on 11th june, I am updating this today. Luckily I got my coding progress for day 24 as I had texted about it to my professor while I was reporting the progress of data Scraper mini project.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload on day 25 after complete testing and final styling of the pages.
 
 ### Day 25: Flask Bucket List date 10-06-2020
 
 **Todays Progress**: Completed front end and began with backend of bucket list web application and completed the scraper website after styling it a bit and submitted it to my professor.
 
 **Thoughts**: I started coding at 10pm and my goal was to code for 1hr minimum but i ended up coding for 4 hrs till 2pm as there was some sort of electrical work going on in my house i decided to code as however i wouldnt get sleep.Hence i am updating my log for june 10th on today ie june 11th. My friend had recently asked me to build a bucket list app for him and i was able to complete front end and now only back end is remaining and i have began with it.

 ### Day 26: Python Hackerank challenges date:11-06-2020
 
 **Today's progress**: Completed remaining 3 introductory challenges in python3 and obtained the second star, with this i have completed all introductory challenges on python.
 
 **Thoughts**: I had started with python and obtained the first star recently in the days of 100daysofcode challenge itself, as mentioned in one of  my previous log commits. Today i completed some 3 challenges and obtained second star. My aim is to get gold batch within completion of lockdown.

### Day 27: Flask Bucket list app date:12-06-2020

**Today's Progress**: I made the bucket list app store the value of previously entered goals by using localStorage methods of js. 

**Thoughts**: coded for 4 hours, debugging the error was a lot of fun and now I have a even more better idea as I feel this will be more better than the current code.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 28: Bucket list app date:13-06-2020

**Today's progress**: Completed the home page for my app and front end for sign in page. 

**Thoughts**: Todays part, the home page was fun to watch working after completion, the way one by one goals get added and it loads even after one browser session gets destroyed or even on refreshing. There was an error in my code today, In every project of mine there will be atleast one which i usually easily debug and correct. Mentioning about this error, as it was fun debugging it. Iam talking of the  new code that i aplied today, which i had mentioned as better one in my yesterday's log commit. The error was that, after the value of itterator (itterator to keep track of paragraphs) was fetched from local storage along with goal entered, it was getting incremented in a differnt way, the time i saw it i new that it was getting concatenated and not incremented, the reason was localstorage. I learnt this new thing that web browser's local storage has its values stored as strings and not in original data type hence i corrected it by converting itterator back to int after recovering it from localstorage and the code worked like magic.

### Day 29: Python Hackerrank challenge and bucket list app date:14-06-2020

**Today's progress**: completed list comprehension  challenge on python in hackerrank and coded on bucket list app

**Thoughts**: Today my mother needed help in house work and as usual i could not tell no hence could code only for 2hr and completed a python challenge on hackerank, now i am only 25 points away to my 3rd star along with which I changed the look of my bucket list app by adding an extra index page and converted my previous index page to home page. Integrated sign up page with index page and now I am working on backend of sign in and sign up pages. 

**Link(s) to work**:https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/blob/master/listcomprehension.py

### Day 30: Bucket list app date:15-06-2020

**Today's Progress**: coded for sign up page backend using PHP.

**Thoughts**: my intention to make a sign up and sign in page for my app is to make it available for multiple users. Initially I coded for sign up backend using jQuery Ajax and then I wanted to render a new template(sign in page) after once signing up is done. But then I got to know that it is not possible and some possible solutions that I tried did not work hence I felt simpler is to use PHP and register users. I managed to code for some 1 and half hours today.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 31: Bucket list app date:16-06-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed sign up page backend and integrated sign up with sign in page.

**Thoughts**: I was working till 11.45pm and coded for 5hrs today. The problem was that I didn't knew flask wasn't compatible with PHP and the time I saw it print my PHP code just like that I deleted all of my PHP code and then recoded jQuery ajax() method that posts the data to main.py and gets the response. This response was continuously being dumped by JSON onto browser console. I tried different methods to display it on the web page and nothing worked this drove me crazy , I might have registered a 1000 users today for testing. I ran Mysql server at the back using xampp and my app interacted with it. Finally I found out that my jQuery code was in a separate file that is signup.js file which was inside js , static folder but then I cut pasted it on to my signup page and then .html(response) method worked this was my preferred  initial plan as well as I thought that inorder to search for an element id the code must be definitely inside the html page but the notion that flask needs to have us code inside js files stopped me from trying this out. Now I had two choices, one is to redirect to a page with flash message and another is to just give a simple message that user is signed up. I preferred the second one as , I felt it's kind of simple and cute way to tell the user that he/she has successfully registered. Henceforth I suppose this is the code that drove me mad completely until now and still I managed to successfully make it work. When I updated this log it hit 12am on 17th June, but log corresponds to 16th June.

### Day 32: Bucket list app date:17-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed sign in page 

**Thoughts**: I again end up coding till 12am , 18thjune. Now only the backend part to store user data remains.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 33: Bucket list app date:18-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: made the app store users goals into database.

**Thoughts**: I coded for 4hours and made the app store the goal as and then entered, into the database.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion


### Day 34: Bucket list app date:19-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed fetching the goals from database and displaying it on home page. 

**Thoughts**: For today I completed user data isolation, handled boundary cases like invalid entries by user, incomplete entries and so on. This completes my app 90% and now only deletion of goal is left out. I would build this mini project with complete perfection as I had done many other projects of mine or as I would do other projects in future, no matter how much ever time it may take, perfection is more important.

### Day 35: To do list app date:20-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed UI for to do list application

**Thoughts**: simultaneous to bucket list app I started to do list app for myself and completed the UI coding. This app has a similar user interface as of Bucket list app.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 36: To do list app date:21-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed UI for the app and backend for delete all list button, began with done checkbox so that it can strike the done list. Coded for 1 hr 15 mins.

**Thoughts**: in the beginning I liked python3 and even now I do, now I have begun to fall for JavaScript.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion.

### Day 37: Bucket list app date:22-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: Started coding for deletion backend. Coded for 1hr

**Thoughts**: apart from my virtual Internship at Microsoft, I coded for 1hr on backend of deleting or striking off the completed goals.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 38: To do list app date:23-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: continued coding for deletion backend

**Thoughts**: whilst I coded for backend I found out some problems with UI ie only arrangement of check boxes, while I thought on checkbox arrangement, I then got a great idea about the entire app's UI would code it in a better way tomorrow and even correct checkbox arrangement. There are even errors in the checkbox backend out of which 3 I resolved. Now there are some remaining that will make my app work.

**Link(s) to work**: Would upload after completion.

### Day 39: Bucket list app date:24-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed delete all goals backend.

**Thoughts**: coded to delete all goals of a particular user using js , jinja and python.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 40: Bucket list app date:25-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed the UI for checkbox, and corrected the checkbox arrangement and worked on deletion backend. Now my app can check any one goal as done.

**Thoughts**: my plan is to take an array for checkbox id and keep track of all goals that were checked as done and then retain the same onload.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 41: Bucket list app date:26-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed check part for checkbox es and even uncheck but there is some problem in the uncheck code which is  yet  to be figured out. Testing for check part is completed it works absolutely fine.

**Thoughts**: This mini project is taking long yet I have enjoyed it most until now.

**Link(s) to work** would upload after completion

### Day 42: Bucket list app date:27-6-2020

**Today's Progress**:Completed the bucket list app for one user and hence my friend's requirement is satisfied. In the multiple user bucketlist with which i was dealing till today is now able to check and uncheck successfully for one user work for multiple user check and uncheck data handling is going on.

**thoughts** I will open sourcing the codebase for single user bucketlist here and i have even tried my best to make it responsive. It suits good on desktop-site of mobile view and on pc's and tablets, especially suits very well on larger screens. I have hosted it on AWS s3, It functions well and i would be keeping it only for some one week for my friends to try. Once i have made it even more responsive and good in UI for mobiles, I will host it on C panel.So that people can try out. Once the multiple user one is working well i will do the same to it.

**Link(s) to my work**:https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Bucketlist
to test the app:  https://bucketlist-sharu.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Bucketlist.html ( valid only for a week)

### Day 43: To-do list app date:28-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed a to-do list app for myself

**Thoughts**: this app shares a similar UI as Bucket list app and provides 100 to-dos for eveyday which is more than enough for me.

### Day 44: Bucket list app date:29-6-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed backend and UI for the app, only little of styling remains.

**thoughts**: after tomorrow once I complete styling of front end , I will continue with covid 19 tracker react app. 

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 45: Bucket list application date:30-6-2020

**Today's progress**: Completed bucket list app for multiple users.

**Thoughts**: For today i have completed bucket list app for multiple users, tested it 5 times(development testing) and it works fine. I am planning to host it on an instance on AWS so that i can make it available for user-testing for those who are interested. It has been approximately one and half month since i took the challenge of coding everyday. And i am happy that i have completed 7 mini-projects and began with two new, completed a course on python and multiple hanckerank challenges. Even completed a geeks for geeks challenge.
