# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: Took up the challenge and commited to it on twitter and LinkedIn date: 16-05-2020
### Day 1:COVID 19 tracker web application date:17-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Almost done with COVID 19 tracker web application on Flask Framework using jinja, python , html and css

**Thoughts:** I had this notion that we can't build a COVID 19 tracker without React.js but i found out that a simple animation less tracker can be built using python and html as well.

**Link to work:** would upload after building the application entirely..check for link in day 2 or 3

### Day 2:COVID Tracker web application date:18-05-2020 

**Today's Progress**: Completed the web application

**Thoughts**: It was an amazing time developing this mini-project. I learnt a new concept of jinja, a template engine that allows developers to write python logic on the html templates.

### Day 3: Bitwise operator challenge-hackerrank date:19-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the bitwise operator challenge on hackerrank in C programming

**Thoughts**:This challenge troubled me since 5 days, only 4 out of the 14 testcases were passing, Later I found out that there was problem with array size and not my logic.

### Day 4:Began with building a COVID 19 tracker  react application and backend for beautician website date:20-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Downloaded visual studio and began with coding. Began with backend for login and registration forms for beautician website. Coded for some 2 hrs.

**Thoughts**: It was my dream to build a react application and know it's details.Hence bringing this dream true. 

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion

### Day 5: Completed backend developement(database part) of registration and login forms for beautician website and would go on for more perfection in it date:21-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: completed backend for beautician website (login , logout and registration) would look at more perfection like allowing user to see the password typed on click, asking user to make password secure and fix a length and give to error message if user doesn't exist or password wrong etc as now the site considers the fact and gives appropriate response. Further to work on the message part 

**Thoughts**:This is my first website with backend developed for it. This was actually an assignment from college but didn't receive enough training on backend through mentors due to lockdown and I am very happy to write it here that I am the first to complete it among my fellow mates.

**Link(s) to work**: (link to backend of login,logout and registration forms and frontend/UI design only) https://github.com/Sharanya-create/100-days-of-code/tree/master/Webpage

### Day 6: Coded a java applet to detect key events and another applet takes the text and writes it to given file date:22-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the code for detecting the key pressed and key released event on applet and the applet viewer would display whatever typed. The other applet took input of file name and text and wrote the text to that file.

**Thoughts**:Have a plan of attaching the second applet project to browser as extension so that it would act as a notepad for browser, for me to take notes while I am surfing through browser.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion ie after I attach the applet to browser as extension.

### Day 7: Completed the second Java applet, mentioned in day 6 with total perfection in orientation and fonts date:23-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed the applet that writes text to a given file.

**Thoughts**: I discarded my plan of adding my applet to my browser as i found that chrome no longer supports Java pluggins and the only way to view applet on browser was adding it to html using Applet tag and viewing using some extensions like CheerpJ, let tab etc. I wanted to keep this project java specific and did not wanted to mix html with it as my favourite combination with html is css, js and offcourse jinja which is python template engine. However adding the applet to chrome would not serve the purpose as i have to switch tabs between my applet page and the current surfing page.

### Day 8:Proceeded with backend developement of beautician website for products pace

**Today's Progress**:Was able to code for one and half hour on the product page of haircare products

**Thoughts**: have some bugs troubling will be resolving them in the coming days.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after I complete all the product pages.

### Day 9: Proceeded with  development of covid 19 tracker application and practiced some java programs on interface in academic interest  date:25-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: Coded for 2 hours, 1 hour on tracker and other on the interface programs. Completed one fourth of the tracker application( till one card up and running)

**Thoughts**: Inspite of my severe headache I managed to code on covid 19 tracker and Java programs but sadly could not update the repo on day 9 itself and hence updating it on day 10. No headache can decrease my passion for coding.

### Day 10: Completed sum of sub array challenge on geeks for geeks date: 26-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: got an institution rank of 27 and score 2 as per alloted for the program.

**Thoughts**: my logic worked well for almost all test cases and errors I managed to correct but I felt it almost impossible to get the execution time down. But then finally I managed to do it with a piece of extra code statement and the execution time was 0.58s

### Day 11: Proceeded with covid 19 tracker react application date:27-05-2020

**Today's Progress**: was able to code only for an hour with the internal assisments comming up , but though I have already completed almost of the mini project, only styling and the graph part remains.

**Thoughts**: Visual studio crashed on my laptop and installing it all again would take more of internet and time. Hence I installed node.js separately on my laptop, added the path to environment variable and began with the development on Atom editor. Was able to code and get all the cards up and running with the count animation applied.

**Link(s) to work**: would upload after completion of the application.
